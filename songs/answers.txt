-- If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
SELECT AVG(energy,valence,danceability) AS avg_score FROM songs ORDER BY listen_quantity DESC LIMIT 100;

--Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
If the reader listens to 2 extremes of music, like 0 aura vs 100 aura, then the code erroneously calculates the average which is 50, which
does not represent the person's style.

Instead, can calculate the mode instead of the average. or provide few ranges.
