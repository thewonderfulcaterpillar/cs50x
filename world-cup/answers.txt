Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
At lower simulation count, higher variance in winner and percentage


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
Depends on how large the fee is. But 10k simulations give more or less the same answer and variance as any number of simulations higher
